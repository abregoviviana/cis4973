# Tech Skills List

Below is a list of applications I learned about during the fall of 2018. For each of these, I went through a guided learning course where I learned the basics of each application. This by no means makes me an expert in any of these applications, but I now have a firm understanding of what they do and how they work.   

### [GitHub](https://github.com/)
GitHub is an open-source, version control system developed by Linus Trovalds (the creator of Linux) that helps developers store, manage, track and control changes to their code. Its user-friendly design makes it easy for even the novice user to make use of it.
